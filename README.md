# DOM I Assignment

This is the starting point for the DOM I assignment. On your team, pick one person to be the owner of the repo.

That person will "fork" this repository. Then, they will add the other members of the group as collaborators.

The others in the group should check their emails (or GitHub notifications) for that invitation, and accept it.

Everyone should copy the URL of the forked repo and clone it on their machine, like so:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/DOM-1-StartingPoint
```

## NOTES

As you are collaborating on this project, make sure you are regularly keeping main up to date:

```
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

If you and another teammate both commit to main without checking to confirm you're up to date with latest changes, one of you will not be able to `git push `. Instead, you'll have to checkout a new branch and add your changes there, or else try to pull from main and resolve any merge conflicts. Preferably, only one person should be pushing to main at a time. Take turns being that person!
